# Informative-Image-Captioning
Image Captioning is the technique in which automatic descriptions are generated for an image. 
The entire code is in the jupyter notebook, so that should hopefully make it easier to understand. 

I have used Flickr8k dataset(size 1 GB). MS-COCO and Flickr30K are other datasets that you can use.

Flickr8K has training images-6000

validation images-1000

testing images-1000

Each image has 5 captions describing it.

For creating the model, the captions has to be put in an embedding. Setting the embedding size to 300. The image below is the model that I used.
